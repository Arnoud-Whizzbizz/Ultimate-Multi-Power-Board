The Ultimate Multi Power Module!

Anyone who ever experiments with Arduinos, or for example fischertechnik models, will sooner 
or later need something that can easily provide multiple ready-made supply voltages. 
For example, to connect an external sensor, it is easy to have 3.3 volts available. 
Or it is convenient to offer 9 and 12 volts during experiments with other external electronics.

Such a module would be useful for powering the controlling controller such as a Zauberling module. 
It would also be useful during experiments in the electronics workshop. Especially if, for example, 
there would be features such as reading of the voltage and current or an automatic fuse.

This day dreaming quickly led to a wish list of the possibilities of such an Ultimate Multi Power Module:

    A module that directly supplies ready-made supply voltages 3.3, 5, 9 and 12 volts
    Amperage up to about 1.5 Ampere
    Monitoring the current draw with milliamp precision
    Useful when maximum peak current is displayed
    Nice extra during experiments: an adjustable automatic fuse
    Preferably to be built into a small fischertechnik 'Silberling' housing (4.5 x 7 x 3 cm)
